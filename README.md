ABOUT ME: Juan MartinezðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer currently on track to get my bachelor's degree by the end of the year. I am presently attending the UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHARLOTTE. Two personal projects that I have worked on are Tic-Tac-Toe using Java Swing and a Website for a Gutter Company. Some goals and objectives I have are creating impressive and innovative projects, getting my bachelor's degree, and creating a spring-boot project by the end of 2024.
