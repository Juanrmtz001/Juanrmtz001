Hi, I am Juan MartinezðŸ‘‹


ABOUT ME:
I am a Software Engineer currently on track to get my bachelor's degree by the end of the year. I am presently attending the UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHARLOTTE. My favorite coding language to use is Java and Python. My most experienced language is Java. I started my coding journey in 2021 using python at a community college but since transferring to UNCC I have been mostly only using Java.

Projects:
Two personal projects that I have worked on are Tic-Tac-Toe using Java Swing and a Website for a Gutter Company.

Goals:
Some goals and objectives I have are creating impressive and innovative projects, getting my bachelor's degree, and creating a spring-boot project by the end of 2024.
